CommandController is a .NET library written in C#. It automates some of the grunt-work required when creating small utility-style programs. In particular, it allows for one or more operations to be defined, where each operation has a number of arguments. CommandController makes it easy to define arguments on an operation by providing a command-line parser with many of the standard validation processes already built-in. The benefit of this is that, if you want to write a small utility program, you no longer need to spend a lot of time on the tedious "plumbing" code, and can therefore get your job done more quickly.
